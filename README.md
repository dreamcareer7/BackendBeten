## Tasks

 - Make sure roles and permissions are working for all possible CRUD actions, Most of them are already just commented out, they just need a little modification to get them working. (Create any necessary gates & permissions you think are missing)
Hamza: Done, Nigusu please check it.

 - Get real data from table and render dashboard overview cards and charts that are visually appealing with the real data â€” preferably using Jquery Ajax for most of them

 - Refer to the database tables diagram to add more relevant features missing
